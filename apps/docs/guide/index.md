# Introduction

**Primitiv** is a design system. **Harmoni** is the palette-generation engine
that powers it. This site documents both, plus a live, interactive workbench.

## Two names, one project

- **Primitiv** — the product: a headless, accessible React component library
  (`@primitiv/react`) with zero styles shipped, plus an icon set
  (`@primitiv/icons`) and design tokens (`@primitiv/tokens`).
- **Harmoni** — the engine: a pure-Rust palette generator (`harmoni-core`)
  with a WebAssembly adapter (`harmoni-wasm`) that runs it in the browser.

## Repo layout

## What's here

- [**React components**](/react/) — every `@primitiv/react` component, with its
  README and a runnable workbench example.
- [**Harmoni**](/harmoni/) — the Rust API and its WASM/TypeScript surface.
- [**Workbench**](/workbench/) — the live app; exercise any component in the
  browser, including on a phone.
