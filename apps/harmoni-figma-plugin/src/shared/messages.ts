 * The postMessage contract between the plugin's two contexts.
 *
 * A Figma plugin runs as two separate programs: the sandbox (`code.ts`,
 * which owns the `figma` global) and the UI (`<iframe>`, which owns the
 * DOM and the harmoni-wasm engine). They communicate only by passing the
 * messages typed below, so both sides import this module.
