## 0. Summary

This document designs the **consumption layer** of Primitiv — how an
external consumer (human or agent) installs and configures the design
system: the tokens, the headless React library, the Harmoni engine, and
the example styles. Publishing itself is a solved, mechanical process
(`.github/workflows/publish.yml`); this doc is about the *shape of the
experience*, not the plumbing.

The key decisions, all settled in the 2026-06-09 design discussion:

1. **A hybrid distribution model split on the logic/style seam.**
   Component *logic* ships as versioned npm/JSR packages
   (`@primitiv-ui/react`, `/icons`, `/tokens`). Component *styles* are an
   **opt-in, copy-in** layer delivered by a CLI from a registry. We do
   **not** ship a second "styled components" package.
2. **A documented styling contract** — a root identifier class plus the
   `data-*` state attributes the headless components already emit — is the
   surface the example styles target. Styles couple to the contract, not
   to Primitiv internals, which is what makes them portable.
3. **Example styles are copy-in editable source**, owned by the consumer
   once installed. They are a **polished default theme** (not a throwaway
   starting point), authored per-component against the token layer and
   **ported from Figma, the source of truth for the whole system**.
4. **One look, many formats.** Example styles are offered in the
   consumer's chosen format (CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, …). All formats are
   derived from the same Primitiv design tokens / CSS custom properties
   and are visually identical. Flexibility is the headline feature.
5. **A Rust CLI is the orchestrator.** It is interactive for humans and
   fully flag-driven / `--json` for agents. A durable `primitiv.json`
   records the consumer's choices so every re-run is deterministic.
6. **A static registry** — `registry.json` plus the style files, served
   from the repo/CDN, no backend — backs the CLI and doubles as the
   machine-readable manifest for agents.

The Button is worked end-to-end in the appendix as the canonical example.

## 1. Current state

What a consumer could grab *today*, and the gaps this design fills.

- **Three packages exist** under `packages/`: `@primitiv-ui/react`
  (headless), `@primitiv-ui/icons`, `@primitiv-ui/tokens` (DTCG JSON).
  All are currently `private: true`, `version 0.0.0`, with source-first
  `exports` pointing at `./src/*.ts`. Publish-readiness is tracked in
  `RELEASING.md` and is out of scope here.
- **`@primitiv-ui/react` is purely headless.** There is no CSS anywhere
  in `packages/`. The only styling that exists lives in `apps/workbench`
  example pages and on the Figma side.
- **Tokens are DTCG JSON** sourced from Figma via the sync plugin. They
  are **not yet transformed** into any consumable format (no CSS custom
  properties, no SCSS, no TS object).
- **The React barrel is a single `.` export.** No per-component subpaths.
- **No CLI exists.**
- **`docs/rfcs/` already holds 0001–0003** with a settled house style.

The headline consequence: the "styles" Developers 2 and 3 want **do not
exist as an artifact yet**. This is a build-and-then-distribute problem,
not a packaging problem — which is why the styling contract and the
token→style pipeline (sections 4 and 6) carry most of the design weight.

---

## 2. Consumer profiles

The four profiles that drive the design. Not exhaustive, but they bracket
the requirement space.

| # | Profile | Wants | Primary mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dev 1** | Has own styling system | Headless components only, possibly a subset | **Package.** `pnpm add @primitiv-ui/react`; subset via tree-shaking / subpaths |
| **Dev 2** | No styling system | The complete solution — headless + tokens in their format + ready styles | **Package + CLI scaffold.** Tokens emitted in chosen format; example styles copied in |
| **Dev 3** | Has a library (e.g. Radix) | Just the *styles* for one / some / all components | **Registry copy-in, à la carte**, against the styling contract |
| **Agent** | Serving a user's project | To evaluate fit and install exactly what's needed, deterministically | **Static registry manifest + non-interactive CLI** |

The same source of truth serves all four; they differ only in *which
layers* they take and *how* they take them.

---

## 3. The hybrid distribution model

There are two distribution models in this space, and the design tension is
the temptation to pick exactly one:

- **Package model** (versioned npm/JSR install): dependency-managed,
  tree-shaken, centrally patchable. Right for *logic* — the a11y, keyboard,
  focus, and roving-tabindex behaviour in `@primitiv-ui/react` is real and
  must not be copy-pasted into thousands of repos where a bugfix can never
  reach it.
- **Registry / copy-in model** (shadcn-style): a CLI writes source into the
  consumer's repo; they own and edit it. Right for *styles* — visual
  customisation is the whole point, and CSS is inseparable from the
  consumer's build (Tailwind? SCSS? plain CSS?).

**Decision: be a deliberate hybrid, split on the logic/style seam.**

- **Logic = versioned package.** `@primitiv-ui/react` stays the headless
  engine. Fixes ship as version bumps. (Likewise `/icons`, `/tokens`.)
- **Styles = opt-in copy-in.** The CLI/registry delivers example styles
  *into* the consumer's repo, targeting the package's styling contract.

This is precisely what a pure shadcn model *cannot* do (it has no runtime
package) and what a pure component library *will not* do (it locks you into
its styling). Primitiv's unique position — a genuine headless engine plus a
token engine (Harmoni) underneath — is what makes the hybrid both possible
and the differentiator.

**Explicitly rejected:** shipping a second `@primitiv-ui/react-styled`
package. Styles are opt-in copy-in, not a parallel install.

---

## 4. The styling contract

Because CSS is coupled to DOM structure and component state, "give me
Primitiv's Button styles for my component" only works if both sides expose
the **same styling surface**. The contract *is* that surface.

**Decision: the contract has four parts — a root class, modifier classes,
the `data-*` state attributes, and a CSS custom-property API.**

- A **root class** identifies the component: `.primitiv-button`,
  `.primitiv-tabs`.
- **Modifier classes** express *purely visual variants the headless layer
  does not model* — tone/intent, size, emphasis: `.primitiv-button--primary`,
  `.primitiv-button--lg`, `.primitiv-tabs--underline`. Applied by the consumer
  (or by a copied-in recipe).
- **`data-*` attributes** express *state and behavioural options the headless
  layer already emits*: `data-state`, `data-disabled`, `data-loading`,
  `data-orientation` (the `data-*` styling surface from the
  `react-component-patterns` conventions). Styling reads these automatically;
  the consumer wires nothing.
- A **CSS custom-property API** per component (`--primitiv-*`) is the themable
  seam (see section 5).

```css
.primitiv-tabs { /* base, reads tokens via --primitiv-tabs-* */ }
.primitiv-tabs--underline { /* visual variant → a modifier class */ }
.primitiv-tabs[data-orientation="vertical"] { /* behavioural → a data attr */ }
.primitiv-button[data-disabled] { /* state → a data attr */ }
```

**The data-vs-modifier rule.** If the headless component already reflects it —
orientation flips keyboard navigation, `disabled`, open/closed state — style
the **`data-*`** attribute; it is emitted for free and stays in sync with
behaviour. If it is a look-only choice the headless layer does not know about —
intent colour, size, emphasis — use a **modifier class**. This is the
cva/shadcn convention and keeps *one*, not two, ways to express each thing.
(So vertical tabs are `[data-orientation="vertical"]`, **not**
`.primitiv-tabs--vertical` — orientation is behavioural.)

Why this and not plain BEM-style classes or pre-styled wrappers:

- **Decouples style from logic.** The CSS targets a documented contract,
  not Primitiv's component internals.
- **Minimal wiring.** Consumers add one root class; state styling is
  automatic because the attributes are already there.
- **Serves Dev 3 honestly.** Any component that emits the same contract —
  including Radix, which largely follows the same `data-*` conventions —
  can reuse the CSS. Framed honestly: this is *best-effort, contract-
  documented*, not magic. Perfect on Primitiv-headless; "to the degree your
  component emits the contract" elsewhere.

**Deliverable:** every component documents its contract — root class, the
`data-*` states it sets, its part/slot names, and its `--primitiv-*` custom
properties. This contract doc is what both the example CSS and external
consumers code against.

## 5. Example styles

The opt-in styled layer. Four sub-decisions, all settled.

### 5.1 Opt-in, with format choice

The CLI **first asks whether** the consumer wants example styles for a
component, and **only then asks the format** (CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, …). A
consumer who wants headless-only never sees a style file. The chosen format
is recorded in `primitiv.json` as the project default; it can be overridden
per `add`.

### 5.2 Ownership — copy-in editable source

Installing example styles **writes editable source files into the
consumer's repo** (e.g. `src/styles/primitiv/button.css`). The consumer
owns them and may edit freely. There is **no silent auto-update**; re-running
`add` refreshes / diffs the files deliberately. This matches the
"styles = copy-in" seam and maximises flexibility.

> **To pin down (see §11):** the exact refresh behaviour on re-add —
> overwrite, three-way diff, or skip-if-modified.

### 5.3 Positioning — polished default theme, ported from Figma

Example styles are a **production-quality default theme**, not a throwaway
reference. They are:

- **Authored per-component** by hand and visually tested — likely in the
  existing `apps/workbench` (which already renders the headless components),
  extended with a styled preview surface.
- **Ported straight from Figma**, the source of truth for the entire
  Primitiv Design System. The Figma variables already back the token layer
  (via the sync plugin → DTCG JSON), so the default theme and the tokens
  share one origin and cannot drift.
- **Re-skinned primarily via token / CSS-custom-property overrides**, not by
  editing component CSS — though, because the source is copied in and owned,
  deep edits remain available as an escape hatch.

This justifies investing in the token/theming layer (section 6): the
default theme stays stable while consumers recolour and re-scale through
tokens.

**Default primary colour.** The default theme ships with Primitiv's own
primary colour as the default value of the primary token (e.g.
`--primitiv-color-primary`), regardless of format — design tokens, a Tailwind
theme config, or otherwise. It is the *default, not a lock-in*. A consumer
overrides it however they like: their own CSS custom properties, a palette
generated from the **Harmoni** Rust library or the Harmoni Figma plugin, or any
other method. Because Harmoni derives a full, contrast-checked palette from a
single brand colour, the canonical re-skin path is "set your brand colour →
regenerate the palette with Harmoni → override the token set" — but nothing
forces it; a hand-edited custom property works just as well.

### 5.4 One look, many formats

A consumer picks the format that fits their stack; **all formats look
identical** because they are all derived from the same Primitiv design
tokens / CSS custom properties:

- **CSS** — custom properties + the contract selectors. The canonical form.
- **SCSS** — same output, exposed as SCSS variables/mixins over the tokens.
- **Tailwind** — a Tailwind **preset/config generated from the tokens** plus
  the component recipes; utilities resolve to the same custom properties.
- **(future)** CSS Modules, vanilla-extract, etc. — added as further
  generated adapters over the one token source.

Authoring implication: the per-component default theme is built once
against the token layer, then **emitted into each format** by the pipeline.
We maintain *one* visual design, not N hand-written stylesheets.

---

## 6. The token & style pipeline

The engine behind sections 4 and 5. One source of truth, many outputs.

```

                                        ▼
                            token transform / emitter

                          │             │             │
                          └─────► consumed by ◄───────┘
                          per-component example styles (one design)

                                        ▼
                          emitted per format into the registry
```

- **Input:** the DTCG JSON already in `@primitiv-ui/tokens`.
- **Transform — a custom Rust emitter, in the CLI (confirmed).** With the CLI
  built in Rust (section 7, D13), the emitter lives in it (or a shared crate)
  and consumes the DTCG JSON via serde directly. This gives full control over
  the contract-specific output (`--primitiv-*` naming, the per-component
  custom-property API), which matters because Primitiv's layered token model
  (primitives → intent → role → anatomy → interaction → component, plus density
  contexts — RFC 0001) is bespoke enough that Style Dictionary would need custom
  transforms anyway. The existing `dtcg.ts` types are a *spec reference to
  port*, not reusable Rust code, so the emitter is net-new (but not much) Rust.
  Outputs: CSS custom properties (canonical), SCSS, a TS/JS token object, and a
  Tailwind preset.
- **Harmoni belongs here.** Because the CLI is Rust, it links the Harmoni
  **core crate directly** (no wasm) to generate a brand palette locally and
  emit it as a theme: `primitiv theme --brand "#0a7755"`. This is the one place
  the Rust engine, the tokens, and the CLI converge — and it gives
  `harmoni-core` a second consumer (native, via the CLI) alongside the wasm
  boundary used by browser/JS consumers, validating that core/wasm split.
- **Example styles** are authored against the canonical CSS custom
  properties, then emitted per format alongside the token output.

`primitiv tokens --format <fmt>` is a thin front-end over this pipeline.

---

## 7. The CLI surface

A Rust CLI is the orchestrator across packages, tokens, and the registry.
Two entry points: a `create-*` scaffold for greenfield, and a binary for
à la carte ops.

```sh
# Greenfield scaffold — interactive
pnpm create @primitiv-ui          # or: npx primitiv init
  → detect framework; ask styling format, token format, brand/theme
  → write primitiv.json

# À la carte — deterministic, agent-friendly
primitiv add button switch         # ensure pkg + (opt-in) copy styles per config
primitiv tokens --format css       # emit tokens in chosen format
primitiv theme --brand "#0a7755"   # Harmoni-generated palette → theme file
primitiv list --json               # machine-readable component registry
```

### 7.1 `primitiv.json` — the durable config

The linchpin that makes re-runs and agent use deterministic. Records:

- framework / target,
- whether example styles are wanted and in which **format**,
- paths / import aliases for where copied files land,
- token output format and theme/brand,
- registry version pin.

Same role as shadcn's `components.json`. Without it, `add` would have to
re-ask everything every time.

### 7.2 `add` flow (per component)

1. Ensure the headless package is installed (or note it's a peer).
2. **Ask whether** example styles are wanted (skip if config already says).
3. If yes and no format recorded, **ask the format**; persist it.
4. Resolve the registry entry's transitive deps (token layer, Tailwind
   preset for the Tailwind format, icon deps, etc.).
5. Copy the editable style source into the configured path.

### 7.3 Interactive vs non-interactive

Every command runs in two modes:

- **Interactive** (human): prompts as above.
- **Non-interactive** (agent / CI): every prompt has a flag; `--yes` accepts
  config defaults; `--json` emits structured output; exit codes are stable.

### 7.4 Implementation & distribution

**The CLI is a Rust binary (D13).** This is a deliberate, first-class goal of
the project — not the marginally-lowest-friction option for a JS-only audience
(a Node/TS shell would edge it there). It earns real secondary merit, though:
it links `harmoni-core` natively for `primitiv theme` (section 6), houses the
token emitter, and keeps the door open to non-JS token consumers (a latent,
not-yet-pressing case).

Distribution follows the **proven native-binary-on-npm pattern** used by Biome,
SWC, lightningcss, and Tailwind's Oxide engine — **not** a fragile
`postinstall` download:

- A thin wrapper package (`primitiv` / `@primitiv-ui/cli`) whose `bin` points at
  a tiny launcher.
- Per-platform packages (`@primitiv-ui/cli-darwin-arm64`,
  `…-linux-x64-gnu`, `…-linux-x64-musl`, `…-win32-x64-msvc`, …), each carrying
  the prebuilt binary and declaring `os`/`cpu`.
- The wrapper lists them in `optionalDependencies`; the package manager installs
  only the matching one. The launcher resolves and execs it.
- `cargo-dist` (or napi-rs) scaffolds the GitHub Actions build matrix and the
  platform packages, removing most of the boilerplate.
- Also installable via `cargo install` for Rust-native users.
- `pnpm create @primitiv-ui` / `npx primitiv init` resolve through the same
  wrapper.

**Consequences for shipping** (RELEASING.md territory, flagged here so it isn't
a surprise): `publish.yml` grows a cross-platform build matrix and a
target-aware "build all targets → publish platform packages → publish wrapper"
ordering. JSR stays source-only and does **not** carry the CLI binary (it's an
npm + Cargo story); the libraries still publish to both.

---

## 8. The registry

**Decision: a static `registry.json` manifest plus the style files**, served
from the repo / GitHub raw / a CDN. No backend.

```
registry.json                     # index: components, versions, deps
r/
  button/
    contract.json                 # root class, data-* states, css-var API
    styles.css                    # canonical
    styles.scss
    tailwind/…                    # preset fragment + recipe
  switch/…
```

- **Simple, cacheable, versioned with the repo**, and trivially mirrored to
  a CDN.
- **Doubles as the agent manifest** (section 9). The same `registry.json`
  the CLI reads is the one an agent inspects.
- A small registry *service* is explicitly deferred — overkill for v1.

---

## 9. AI agent affordances

The Agent profile is first-class, not bolted on:

- **`registry.json` at a stable URL** — an agent can fetch it to evaluate
  whether Primitiv fits, enumerate components, and read each component's
  contract and dependencies *before* installing anything.
- **Non-interactive CLI** — `--json`, flag-driven prompts, `--yes`, stable
  exit codes (section 7.3).
- **`primitiv list --json`** — the component index as data.
- **An `AGENTS.md` / `llms.txt`** describing the system, the contract, and
  the install recipes, so an agent can act without scraping prose docs.
- **(future)** an MCP server wrapping the CLI for agents that prefer tools
  over shelling out.

## 10. Decisions log (settled 2026-06-09)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Hybrid model: logic = versioned package, styles = opt-in copy-in |
| D2 | No second "styled components" package |
| D3 | Styling contract = root class + modifier classes (visual variants) + `data-*` (state/behavioural) + `--primitiv-*` custom-property API; the data-vs-modifier rule decides which surface a given option uses |
| D4 | Example styles = copy-in **editable** source, owned by the consumer |
| D5 | Example styles = **polished default theme**, re-skinned via tokens, **ported from Figma** |
| D6 | One visual design, emitted in many formats (CSS/SCSS/Tailwind/…), all token-derived |
| D7 | CLI asks **whether** styles, then **which format**; persists to `primitiv.json` |
| D8 | Registry = **static** `registry.json` + files, no backend |
| D9 | Agent support is first-class: static manifest + non-interactive `--json` CLI |
| D10 | Capture as **split RFCs** 0004 / 0005 / 0006 (this doc seeds them) |
| D11 | Default theme's default primary = Primitiv's own primary colour; a default, not a lock-in — overridable via tokens / CSS custom properties / a Harmoni-generated palette (Rust lib or Figma plugin) |
| D12 | Token transform = **custom Rust emitter inside the CLI** (consumes DTCG via serde), over Style Dictionary — for full control of contract-specific output |
| D13 | **CLI is a Rust binary** — a deliberate first-class project goal (craft), with native `harmoni-core` linking + latent non-JS-consumer support as secondary merit. Distributed via the Biome/SWC `optionalDependencies` per-platform-package pattern + `cargo install`; **not** a Node/TS shell (which would be marginally lower-friction but is explicitly not chosen) |
| D14 | Compound components name parts **BEM-style** off the root class (`.primitiv-tabs__trigger`) |
| D15 | `contract.json` is **hybrid**: the `data-*` half is auto-verified against the rendered component; modifier classes + custom properties are authored with the stylesheet |
| D16 | Per-component subpath exports (`@primitiv-ui/react/button`) ship **alongside** the barrel (generated); tree-shaking still serves subsets |
| D17 | Dev 3 reach: **document the contract boundary** for v1; no Radix testing or attribute shimming |
| D18 | `add` refresh = **detect & prompt** on conflict (hash vs originally-written); `--force`/`--yes` flags; never silently clobber edits |
| D19 | Project wiring (e.g. Tailwind preset registration) = **detect & offer to patch**; never silently edit a consumer-owned config |
| D20 | CLI front door = unscoped **`primitiv-ui`** + **`create-primitiv-ui`** (the bare `primitiv` npm name is owned by an unrelated product, Primitiv AI); platform binaries scoped `@primitiv-ui/cli-*`; libraries stay `@primitiv-ui/*`. Reserve the unscoped names **now** (first-come); scoped can wait (scope owned); JSR not involved for the CLI |
| D21 | v1 platform matrix = common desktop set (`darwin-arm64/x64`, `linux-x64/arm64-gnu`, `win32-x64`); musl as fast-follow; `cargo install` fallback |
| D22 | Command users type = **`primitiv`** (a local bin, unaffected by the package-name collision); no short global bin shipped (clash-prone — e.g. `pv` = pipe viewer); power users alias on their own machines |
| D23 | Token emitter produces **all four formats from day one**: CSS custom properties (canonical), SCSS, TS/JS object, Tailwind preset — from one Rust emitter |
| D24 | v1 ships **light theme + dark tokens** (dark ramps already exist as Figma Intent Light/Dark modes); no bespoke per-component dark CSS; dark **values stay evolvable** (consumers depend on `--primitiv-*` names, not values) |
| D25 | Default theme authored & visually checked by **extending `apps/workbench`** with a styled preview (a conscious exception to the "leave the workbench alone" rule) |
| D26 | CLI configures an **existing** project, never generates one; **React-only** component logic (the `framework` field is forward-looking); **tiered** support — Tier-0 (install/tokens/styles) works anywhere, Tier-1 auto-wiring for a maintained set, Tier-2 prints a manual snippet so unknown setups degrade rather than fail |
| D27 | v1 first-class auto-wiring = **Vite + React** and **Next.js**; Remix / Astro / unknown fall back to the manual snippet |
| D28 | A from-scratch project generator is **deferred past v1**; `create-primitiv-ui` is name-reserved but in v1 just runs `init` in an already-created app (errors helpfully on an empty dir) |
| D29 | CLI test architecture = **ports & adapters**: pure core + effect traits (`FileSystem`, `PackageManager`, `Registry`, `Prompter`) faked in tests, real at the edge; `primitiv-cli` is lib + thin bin; the emitter is its own `primitiv-emit` crate; the agent flags (`--json`/`--yes`/`--dry-run`/`--registry path`) double as test seams |
| D30 | **100% coverage** across the CLI workspace; **Rust enters CI** (`cargo test` + `cargo llvm-cov` gate) — it runs in no workflow today |
| D31 | Generated outputs asserted via **hand-authored golden files** + exact compare (pure red-green); **snapshot testing (`insta`) ruled out entirely** — not a dependency; diff ergonomics come from `pretty_assertions` (updated 2026-06-10) |
| D32 | `aliases` are **detected** from tsconfig/jsconfig `compilerOptions.paths` at `init`, overridable by prompt or `--alias-*` flag, persisted in `primitiv.json`; relative-import fallback when absent; minimal set (only emitted targets) given the hybrid model |
| — | **Parked:** CSS Modules as a styling-output format — kept to the four formats (D23) for v1; revisit once RFC 0004 settles whether the headless component hard-emits a root class (RFC 0006 §10.6) |

**CSS architecture follow-up (2026-06-10) — RFC 0008.** A later pass settled how
the emitted CSS is ordered and how the token output is scoped:

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D33 | All Primitiv CSS is emitted inside one top-level `@layer primitiv` with ordered sublayers `tokens → theme → base → variants → states`; a consumer's **unlayered** CSS always wins (no specificity war), making "you own and edit it" structural |
| D34 | Sublayer order encodes precedence: `data-*` **state** > **variant** modifier class > **base** — resolving the ordering RFC 0004 §3.2's data-vs-modifier rule left open |
| D35 | Primitiv-emitted CSS contains **no `!important`** — the layer is the override mechanism (an important rule would invert layer precedence and beat the consumer) |
| D36 | Token output is **two-tier**: shared theme tokens (`--primitiv-<token-path>`) emitted **once**, never pruned (the global re-skin surface, `primitiv.tokens`); per-component API tokens (`--primitiv-<component>-<part>`) ship **inside each component stylesheet** (`primitiv.base`), so a partial install carries only the components added |
| D37 | **Reject** subsetting the shared theme-token file for v1 — it breaks `primitiv theme` re-skin and cross-component consistency, the size win is negligible, and names are the contract |
| D38 | Shared theme-token emit is **idempotent** (write-once, refreshed under the D18 rules); `primitiv theme` overrides occupy a `primitiv.theme` sublayer so they beat base tokens by layer order, not load order — recommending RFC 0006 §10.4 resolve as a separate file |

**Mode scoping — theme & density (2026-06-10) — RFC 0009.** Generalises the
dark-mode scope into two orthogonal mode axes set as inheritable DOM attributes:

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D39 | Theme and density are **two orthogonal, inheritable DOM-attribute scopes** (`data-theme`, `data-density`); a mode is a *scope*, not a token name; custom-property inheritance reproduces Figma's page → frame → child density model on the web |
| D40 | **Attributes, not classes**, for both axes (resolves RFC 0006 §10.1's selector question); kept as **separate** attributes — orthogonal, no `data-mode="dark-dense"` combinatorial explosion |
| D41 | Density values = Figma `Context` modes (`dense`/`compact`/`comfortable`/`spacious`); **default density = comfortable**, default theme = light; `prefers-color-scheme` stays **opt-in** |
| D42 | Density-dependent tokens emit under **density-neutral names**; the `context.<density>` axis collapses into `[data-density]` scopes living in the `primitiv.tokens` layer (RFC 0008) |
| D43 | Model works across **all four formats** with no per-format reinvention; Tailwind wiring documented — remap the `dark:` variant to `[data-theme="dark"]`, optional `data-[density]` variants; v4 utilities inherit the active mode automatically (CSS-variable-native) |
| D44 | **v1 ships attribute-based density**; **responsive (container-query) density is designed-in but deferred** — additive on the same value-sets (each density also exposed as a container-applicable block + a `container-type` helper); CSS style-queries the eventual purest path |

**Open-question clear-out (2026-06-10) — before building.** Settling the live RFC
open questions ahead of implementation:

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D45 | The **headless component emits its root/part identity classes** (`.primitiv-button`, `.primitiv-tabs__trigger`), merged with any consumer `className` — so a "component + styles" install needs no hand-wired identity class. **Only** root/part classes are emitted (modifiers stay consumer/recipe-applied) and **only** semantic classes (never utilities — the package stays styling-agnostic for Dev 1). Resolves RFC 0004 §7.5; unblocks the CSS-Modules story (RFC 0006 §10.6) — module projects consume the global contract stylesheet |
| D46 | Tailwind output target = **v4 only** for v1 (CSS-variable-native); v3 best-effort via `data-[…]:` variants, not a promise. Resolves RFC 0006 §10.3 |
| D47 | Emitted TS/JS token object = **nested + typed** (`tokens.color.primary`), **CLI-emitted** like the other formats (per D23), not hand-maintained. Resolves RFC 0006 §10.2 |
| D48 | `primitiv theme --brand` emits a **paired light + dark** palette in v1; the emitted **structure (names, file shape, `[data-theme]` scope) is the stable contract**, while dark *values* track `harmoni-core`'s dark ramp and evolve **non-breakingly** (Principle 2). Resolves RFC 0005 §9.1 |
| D49 | **Operational ratifications:** theme overrides = separate file in `primitiv.theme` (RFC 0006 §10.4); coverage = `cargo-llvm-cov`, command tests = in-memory FS + e2e = `assert_fs` (RFC 0007 §11); `primitiv.reset` reserved-empty + per-component stylesheets re-open named layers + Tailwind layer/`dark:` wiring reuses the D19 detect-and-offer mechanism (RFC 0008 §7, RFC 0009 §8.3); written-file manifest = separate `primitiv.lock`-style sibling, registry = GitHub raw at the pinned tag (CDN fast-follow), package managers = pnpm/npm/yarn/bun with **Deno out of scope v1** (RFC 0005 §9) |
| D50 | **TS/JS token object dropped — supersedes D47 and the TS clause of D23.** The supported formats are the **three cascade-based ones: CSS (canonical), SCSS, Tailwind**. They emit `var()` references and let the CSS cascade resolve theme/density modes at runtime; a TS object **inlines** concrete values and so cannot — the mode-varying tokens it was blocked on (the paired light+dark brand ramp, density sizes) are precisely the ones that *must not* be frozen into JS (a consumer needing them in JS should read the CSS custom property so the cascade still applies). The legitimate niche — mode-*independent* primitives in JS — never justified the perpetual special-case against a cascade-first system whose closest analogue (shadcn/ui) ships no JS tokens. Removed from `primitiv-emit` (the base-only `emit_ts` / `emit_ts_tokens` and the inlining resolvers that served only it); the build-time `dtcg.ts` types in `packages/tokens` are unaffected. Reopen only with a concrete multi-platform (React Native) or type-safe-token-DX goal |

**Consumer DX & decoupling (2026-06-12) — settling the styled-surface shape
while authoring Button's formats:**

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D51 | **A styled wrapper component is the primary DX (shadcn parity).** `primitiv add <component>` copies a thin wrapper (`button.tsx`) that composes the headless `@primitiv-ui/react` component with the copied recipe and exposes typed variant props — the familiar `<Button variant size>` surface. Three layers, primary → escape hatch → ground truth: **(1)** the wrapper (props); **(2)** the recipe function (shadcn's `buttonVariants` equivalent — classes on a non-component element / `asChild` link); **(3)** the raw contract classes (`primitiv-button--primary`, framework-agnostic, documented). The wrapper is copied into the consumer repo, so the **published headless package stays styling-agnostic** — consistent with D45 (modifiers stay consumer/recipe-applied; the wrapper is "consumer-applied"). The headless import remains the full-control (Radix-style) path |
| D52 | **Variant prop name = `variant`; `intent` stays the design-system term.** The consumer-facing prop is `variant` (heavily used across libraries → familiarity); `intent` remains the Primitiv / Figma / token vocabulary and the canonical contract modifier-group **key**. The contract declares the surfaced prop name per group (`"prop": "variant"`, defaulting to the group key — so `size` stays `size`). The class **values** (`primitiv-button--primary`) are unchanged, so drift guards key off classes, not names |
| D53 | **The contract is the single authored API source; the recipe and wrapper are generated from it.** `contract.json` is enriched: each modifier group carries `description`, `default`, an optional `prop`, and `options` mapping each value to `{ class, description }`; the component carries `description` + `docs`. From this one source `primitiv-emit` generates **both** the cva recipe and the **JSDoc'd wrapper** (component + variant-prop docs; headless-prop docs flow free from the package types via `extends`). The recipe therefore joins SCSS as a **generated** artifact (the D-"Registry CSS, derive rest" hand-authored recipe becomes the generator's golden). Per component the **authored** surface collapses to `contract.json` (API spec) + `styles.css` (visual design) + the headless component; SCSS, recipe, wrapper, and the token layer are all generated. You author the *spec*, never the boilerplate. Where a component outgrows the schema, extend the schema **once** (a generic capability every component gains); a fully bespoke wrapper can still be hand-authored and copied as the escape hatch |
| D54 | **The CLI/emit stay decoupled from any specific component (the build invariant).** Adding or changing a component — new props, renamed variants, a restyle, a new format — must touch **only** the registry (`contract.json` / `styles.css`) and the headless package, **never** `primitiv-cli` or `primitiv-emit` *logic*. The CLI knows only formats (a closed enum), the contract *schema*, and file ops via ports; the emitter knows only generic transforms (DTCG→tokens, CSS→SCSS, contract→recipe, contract→wrapper). Component facts live only as registry **data**. **Enforcement:** CLI/emit unit + command tests run against **synthetic fixture contracts**, never Button/Switch; real components appear only in the e2e smoke layer. **Button** (modifier-driven, single part) and **Switch** (state-driven, a `__thumb` part, no `variant`) are the deliberately-different proof that one schema + one generator set + one CLI serve every shape across CSS/SCSS/Tailwind and stay amenable to design/prop evolution |
| D55 | **The styled surface (recipe + wrapper) is gated by the styles opt-in, not the format — revises #139's Tailwind-scoping of cva.** The recipe + wrapper produce format-independent class *strings*, so they ship for **any** styled React consumer (css / scss / tailwind) — the format only selects which stylesheet defines the rules behind those classes. So `class-variance-authority` is a **styled-surface** dependency (`registry.json` → `styles.packages`), ensured whenever styles are added and **never** for a headless-only install (which stays pristine: `@primitiv-ui/react` alone, full control). The recipe moves out of `tailwind/` to the component root beside the wrapper; `formats` selects only the stylesheet |

## 11. Open questions

To resolve before / within the RFCs:

1. ~~Re-add refresh semantics~~ — **resolved (D18):** detect & prompt on
   conflict; `--force`/`--yes`; never silently clobber edits. (RFC 0005 §4.2.)
2. ~~Transitive wiring (auto vs instruct)~~ — **resolved (D19):** detect & offer
   to patch; never silently edit a consumer config. (RFC 0005 §4.3.)
3. ~~Per-component subpath exports~~ — **resolved (D16):** ship subpaths
   alongside the barrel; tree-shaking still serves subsets.
4. ~~Emitter language / location~~ — **resolved (D12):** custom Rust emitter in
   the CLI.
5. ~~CLI distribution~~ — **resolved (D13, D20, D21):** `optionalDependencies`
   per-platform packages + `cargo install`; unscoped `primitiv`/`create-primitiv`
   wrappers, scoped `@primitiv-ui/cli-*` binaries; common-desktop-gnu matrix with
   musl as a fast-follow. (RFC 0005 §7.)
6. ~~Dev 3 reach~~ — **resolved (D17):** document the contract boundary for v1;
   no Radix testing or attribute shimming.
7. ~~Workbench role~~ — **resolved (D25):** extend `apps/workbench` with a
   styled preview surface (a conscious exception to the "leave the workbench
   alone" rule). (RFC 0006 §7.)

## 12. How this seeds the RFCs

Per D10, this doc is promoted into three tightly-scoped RFCs (matching the
0001–0003 style):

- **RFC 0004 — Consumption distribution model & styling contract.**
  Sections 3 and 4. The foundation: the hybrid seam and the `data-*` +
  root-class contract. Settle first; the others depend on it.
  **Drafted →** `docs/rfcs/0004-consumption-distribution-and-styling-contract.md`.
- **RFC 0005 — The Primitiv CLI & `primitiv.json`.** Sections 7, 8, 9.
  Surface, config, registry, agent affordances.
  **Drafted →** `docs/rfcs/0005-primitiv-cli.md`.
- **RFC 0006 — Token & style pipeline.** Sections 5 and 6. DTCG → formats,
  the one-design-many-formats emitter, the Figma-sourced default theme, and
  Harmoni's role in theming.
  **Drafted →** `docs/rfcs/0006-token-and-style-pipeline.md`.

## Appendix — Button, end to end

How each profile consumes the Button under this design.

**Dev 1 (headless only):**
```sh
pnpm add @primitiv-ui/react
```
```tsx
import { Button } from "@primitiv-ui/react";
// styled by their own system; no Primitiv CSS involved
```

**Dev 2 (complete solution, SCSS):**
```sh
npx primitiv init           # picks SCSS, sets brand → primitiv.json
primitiv add button         # ensures pkg, asks styles? yes → SCSS
```
```scss
// src/styles/primitiv/_button.scss copied in, owned, editable
// resolves to --primitiv-button-* custom properties from the token layer
```
```tsx
import { Button } from "@primitiv-ui/react";
<Button className="primitiv-button" />;   // contract root class
```

**Dev 3 (has Radix, wants only Button's look):**
```sh
primitiv add button --styles-only --format css
```
```css
/* button.css targets the contract: .primitiv-button + data-* state.
   Applied to a Radix button to the degree it emits the same contract. */
```

**Agent:**
```sh
curl …/registry.json                 # evaluate fit, read Button's contract + deps
primitiv add button --yes --json     # deterministic install, structured result
```
