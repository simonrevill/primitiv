/**
 * The keyboard half of the WAI-ARIA roving-tabindex pattern: maps
 * arrow / Home / End / Enter-Space keys to navigation between siblings
 * in a compound widget, with optional RTL inversion and Home/End/
 * Enter-Space toggles. The state half (which key is the current Tab
 * stop, focus management, the actual selection / activation) lives in
 * the consumer — the hook just decides "given this key press, which
 * sibling should we navigate to?" and delegates via `onNavigate`.
 *
 * The orientation/dir/Home-End/activate keymap is built by
 * {@link getKeyToActionMap}, which the hook composes internally.
 *
 * The action passed to `onNavigate` is the abstract `RovingKeyAction`
 * vocabulary: `"next" | "prev" | "first" | "last" | "activate"`.
 * Consumers that only care about movement can ignore the action;
 * consumers that distinguish navigation-vs-activation (Tabs in manual
 * activation mode) branch on it.
 *
 * @example RadioGroup — select on every arrow, both orientations
 * ```ts
 * const enabledValues = itemValues.filter((v) => !disabledValues.has(v));
 * const { handleKeyDown } = useRovingTabindex({
 *   orientation: "both",
 *   navigable: enabledValues,
 *   currentKey: value,
 *   onNavigate: (target) => {
 *     select(target);
 *     focusItem(target);
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @example Tabs — land on disabled but only activate enabled, supports manual mode
 * ```ts
 * const { handleKeyDown } = useRovingTabindex({
 *   orientation, dir,
 *   navigable: triggerValues, // unfiltered: arrow lands on disabled
 *   currentKey: value,
 *   includeHomeEnd: true,
 *   includeActivate: true,
 *   onNavigate: (target, action) => {
 *     const isDisabled = disabledTriggerValues.has(target);
 *     const shouldActivate =
 *       !isDisabled &&
 *       (activationMode === "automatic" ||
 *         (activationMode === "manual" && action === "activate"));
 *     if (shouldActivate) activateTab(target);
 *     focusItem(target);
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
