# MillerColumns

A compound component for the **Miller columns** pattern (also called
cascading lists or the macOS Finder "column view"): a horizontal strip
of vertical lists where selecting a node reveals its children in the
next column to the right.

```tsx
import { MillerColumns } from "@primitiv/react";

function Node({ node }) {
  return (
    <MillerColumns.Item value={node.id}>
      {node.label}
      {node.children?.length ? (
        <>
          <MillerColumns.ItemIndicator>▸</MillerColumns.ItemIndicator>
          <MillerColumns.Column>
            {node.children.map((child) => (
              <Node key={child.id} node={child} />
            ))}
          </MillerColumns.Column>
        </>
      ) : null}
    </MillerColumns.Item>
  );
}

<MillerColumns.Root defaultValue={["docs", "guides"]}>
  <MillerColumns.Column>
    {tree.map((node) => (
      <Node key={node.id} node={node} />
    ))}
  </MillerColumns.Column>
</MillerColumns.Root>;
```

## Authoring model

The tree is authored by **recursive composition** — there is no `data`
prop. An `Item` becomes a *branch* by nesting a
`<MillerColumns.Column>` among its children; that nested column lists
the item's children, each of which is another `Item`. An `Item` with no
nested column is a *leaf*.

Although child columns are authored nested, every `Column` is
**portal-projected** into the `Root` strip, so the active columns sit
side-by-side in a single left-to-right row regardless of how deeply
they were declared.

A branch's nested column is only **mounted while that branch is
selected**, so a consumer's recursive `Node` component naturally stops
recursing at inactive branches — only the columns along the active path
are ever rendered.

## Sub-components

| Export                       | Role          | Notes                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MillerColumns.Root`          | State owner   | Uncontrolled (`defaultValue`) or controlled (`value` + `onValueChange`); renders the strip     |
| `MillerColumns.Column`        | List          | A vertical list of items, projected into the strip as `role="group"`                           |
| `MillerColumns.Item`          | Tree node     | A `role="treeitem"`; branch when it nests a `Column`. Supports `disabled`, `asChild`, `ref`     |
| `MillerColumns.ItemIndicator` | Icon wrapper  | Decorative `aria-hidden` icon, rendered only for branch items                                  |
| `MillerColumns.ResizeHandle`  | Resize grip   | A `role="separator"` drag handle that sets its column's width                                   |
| `MillerColumns.PreviewPanel`  | Preview pane  | A content-agnostic trailing panel; pair with `useMillerColumnsSelection`                        |

## Selection model

The selection is a single **active path** — an array of item ids from
the root column down to the deepest selected item. Selecting an item at
depth _d_ truncates the path to _d_ and appends the new id, so every
column deeper than _d_ closes.

- **Uncontrolled** — pass `defaultValue` (or omit it to start with
  nothing selected).
- **Controlled** — pass `value` and `onValueChange` together. The
  parent owns the path; the component defers every change back through
  the callback.

The two shapes are discriminated at the type level: passing
`defaultValue` alongside `value` is a type error.

There is no multi-select — only one path is active at a time.

## Keyboard interaction

| Key                 | Behaviour                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown` | Move focus within the focused column (wraps, skips disabled items) |
| `Home` / `End`      | Focus the first / last item of the focused column                      |
| `Enter` / `Space`   | Select the focused item                                                |
| `ArrowRight`        | Branch: select it and move focus to its child column's first item; leaf: no-op |
| `ArrowLeft`         | Move focus to the selected item of the parent column                   |
| `Tab`               | Move into / out of the whole tree (single tabstop)                     |

The strip is a single roving-tabindex widget: exactly one item is
tabbable at a time. The tabstop follows the last-focused item and
defaults to the deepest selected item, falling back to the first item
of the root column.

## Auto-scroll

When selecting a branch reveals a new column, the strip scrolls to its
trailing edge so the newly opened column is brought into view. This
fires only when a column is *added* — neither the initial render nor
closing a column scrolls the strip. Scrolling only has a visible
effect when the strip is itself an overflow container; give
`[data-miller-columns-strip]` an `overflow-x` for it to take hold.

## ARIA

- The strip is `role="tree"`.
- Each `Column` is `role="group"`.
- Each `Item` is `role="treeitem"` with `aria-level` (1-based column
  depth), `aria-selected`, and — on branch items — `aria-expanded`.

## Disabled items

Pass `disabled` on an `Item` to render `aria-disabled="true"` and
`data-disabled`, ignore clicks and activation keys, and skip the item
during arrow-key navigation. Disabled items remain in the DOM and
focusable for discovery.

## Resizable columns

Drop a `MillerColumns.ResizeHandle` among a `Column`'s children to make
that column drag-resizable. The handle renders a
`<div role="separator" aria-orientation="vertical">`; while it is
pointer-dragged it drives that column's width as state on the `Root`,
applied as the column's inline `width`.

```tsx
<MillerColumns.Column className="column">
  <MillerColumns.ResizeHandle className="resize-handle" />
  {items}
</MillerColumns.Column>
```

The handle ships with no styles or position — give it a width and pin
it to the column's trailing edge yourself:

```css
.column {
  position: relative;
}
.resize-handle {
  position: absolute;
  inset-block: 0;
  inset-inline-end: 0;
  width: 6px;
  cursor: col-resize;
}
.resize-handle[data-dragging] {
  /* feedback while a drag is in progress */
}
```

The first drag measures the column's current rendered width and
resizes from there; later drags resume from the last resized width. A
width is clamped so it can never be dragged below zero — use CSS
`min-width` for any larger floor. Resize is pointer-only; the handle
is not keyboard-operable.

## Preview panel

`MillerColumns.PreviewPanel` is a trailing pane — the macOS-Finder
"preview" column — rendered as the last child of the strip, to the
right of the columns. It is deliberately **content-agnostic**: the
component cannot know how to preview an item, so the consumer decides
what the panel shows. Author it as the last child of `Root`, a sibling
of the root `Column`:

```tsx
<MillerColumns.Root>
  <MillerColumns.Column>{items}</MillerColumns.Column>
  <MillerColumns.PreviewPanel>
    <FilePreview />
  </MillerColumns.PreviewPanel>
</MillerColumns.Root>
```

To render content for whatever is selected, read the selection with
the `useMillerColumnsSelection` hook from any component inside `Root`:

```tsx
import { useMillerColumnsSelection } from "@primitiv/react";

function FilePreview() {
  const { path, selectedValue } = useMillerColumnsSelection();
  if (!selectedValue) {
    return <p>Nothing selected</p>;
  }
  return <Preview id={selectedValue} />;
}
```

`useMillerColumnsSelection` returns the active `path` and the deepest
`selectedValue` (`undefined` when nothing is selected). It works for
both controlled and uncontrolled roots, and throws if called outside
`MillerColumns.Root`.

The panel ships with no ARIA role. The strip is a `role="tree"`, whose
conforming children are `treeitem`s and `group`s — so give the panel
content its own labelled landmark (`role`, `aria-label`, …) through
props if the preview warrants being announced.

## `asChild` composition

`MillerColumns.Item` accepts `asChild` to render the cell as a
consumer-supplied element instead of the default `<div>`. All treeitem
ARIA attributes, event handlers, and the internal ref are merged onto
the child (child handler runs first, then the component's). A nested
`<MillerColumns.Column>` is still declared as a sibling of the cell
element:

```tsx
<MillerColumns.Item<HTMLAnchorElement> asChild value="docs">
  <a href="#docs">Docs</a>
  <MillerColumns.Column>…</MillerColumns.Column>
</MillerColumns.Item>
```

A `ref` prop (React 19 ref-as-prop style) is forwarded to the rendered
element and composed with the library's internal ref.

## Styling hooks

Zero styles ship with the component. Style it through `data-*` hooks;
typically the strip is `display: flex` and each column scrolls
vertically.

Inside the strip, each column is wrapped in a transparent
(`display: contents`) slot element that fixes left-to-right order — so
target columns with `[data-miller-columns-column]`, not a direct-child
selector like `[data-miller-columns-strip] > *`.

```css
[data-miller-columns-strip] {
  display: flex;
}
[data-miller-columns-column] {
  overflow-y: auto;
}
[data-miller-columns-column][data-depth="0"] {
  /* the root column */
}
[role="treeitem"][data-state="selected"] {
  /* the selected item in each column */
}
[role="treeitem"][data-has-children] {
  /* branch items */
}
[role="treeitem"][data-disabled] {
  opacity: 0.5;
}
```

| Element         | Attributes                                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strip (`Root`)  | `data-miller-columns-strip`, `data-orientation="horizontal"`                |
| `Column`        | `data-miller-columns-column`, `data-depth`                                  |
| `Item`          | `data-state="selected" \| "unselected"`, `data-depth`, `data-has-children`, `data-disabled` |
| `ItemIndicator` | `data-state`, `data-has-children`                                           |
| `ResizeHandle`  | `data-miller-columns-resize-handle`, `data-dragging` (present mid-drag)     |
| `PreviewPanel`  | `data-miller-columns-preview`                                               |

## Deferred / follow-up work

The following were intentionally left out of the first version and are
good candidates for later, independent cycles:

1. **Context-menu image preview.** Once a Context Menu component
   exists, a leaf image `Item` could open a context menu on
   right-click whose first entry ("Preview", with an eye icon) opens
   the `Modal` to show the image larger.
2. **Keyboard-operable resize.** `MillerColumns.ResizeHandle` is
   pointer-only; an arrow-key resize on the focused handle would round
   out the WAI-ARIA window-splitter pattern.
